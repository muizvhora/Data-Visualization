# Data-Visualization
Creating plots using Matplotlib, based on Tutorials by Sentdex, on YouTube.

Fetch stock prices data from the Yahoo! Financial API and create 3 different subplots to visualize nature of stock movement.

Plot-1: Daily high and low prices are plot. 

Plot-2: Candlestick OHLC (Open High Low Close) prices for stock

Plot-3: Moving average for a set period to determine trend for stock movement.

*Also, we identify and annotate point of Maximum Rise within graph.
